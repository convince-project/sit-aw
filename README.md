# sit-aw

sit-aw is a software pipeline for robot situation awareness, part of the [CONVINCE toolchain](https://convince-project.github.io/overview/). It enables known and unknown anomaly detection, identification and resolution.

Below there is a list of the available software modules in the different releases of the sit-aw pipeline. Each module is provided with documentation that contains a tutorial demonstrating the module functionality.

An overall tutorial on how to run the full pipeline on a coherent example will be added at a later stage of the project.

## 0.1.0 (End of May 2024)

- [sit-aw-anchoring](https://github.com/convince-project/sit-aw-anchoring), the semantic anchoring module.

   Semantic anchoring is the process in the robot situation awareness pipeline that integrates numerical data coming from perception with information in one (or more) digital twin(s), to produce a symbolic representation (belief) of current and predicted observations of operational environment.
